# ATM_Machine
Demo Java Application simulating ATM operations

## Installation
Clone the application:
```
git clone https://github.com/marcelus20/ATM_Machine
```

Navigate to project root directory:
```
cd ATM_Machine
```

Before invoking the docker-compose build, you first need to compile the /atm service. 

```bash
# Navigate to the atm folder and build the jar
cd atm
# Build the atm service
mvn clean build
```

A jar file should have been created inside /atm/target/. Once that's done, you are good to run the docker-compose command to build the intire application: 

```bash
# Go back to the root project folder and invoke docker-compose build and up
cd ..
docker-compose build
#run application
docker-compose up
```
